# Event-Listing

Website hosted on GitHub Pages - <a href='https://superkusya.github.io/Event-Listing/'>Event-Listing</a>

The page provides information about concerts. There is a search on it - select elements and cards with events. When the screen width is changed, the elements are proportionally reduced. 
By default, the search fields are set to All. And the page displays cards with all events.

The selection of events has been implemented:

- by city
- by months (all events are presented for 2019, search only by months)

Validation
- Nu Html Checker (Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show)
